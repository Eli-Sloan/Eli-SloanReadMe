# Eli Sloan  
Root Cause QA • Log Forensics • Automation Reliability

I specialize in breaking systems quietly, then showing you exactly where they failed.

Whether it’s a misfiring API, an unstable ML pipeline, or just a buried crash report no one has time to decode—I’ll pull the thread and hand you the summary. I work independently, deliver without hand-holding, and document everything clearly so your team can focus on building.

## Core Strengths
- Log and telemetry parsing for AI/LLM systems  
- Root cause detection from vague or inconsistent failure states  
- Automation pipeline triage (Python, Selenium, XCTest)  
- Test design for edge cases and regression scenarios  
- QA documentation with structured, minimal overhead

---

## Tools and Workflow
- Python, Bash, Selenium, XCUITest  
- GitHub Actions, Jira, Notion, Postman  
- CI/CD debugging, API test harnesses, crash dump review

## Featured Repo  
**[Error Harvester](https://github.com/Eli-Sloan/error-harvester)**  
A minimalist log parser that extracts critical failure events and groups them by severity and component. Built for speed triage in chaotic systems.

## Contact  
For project inquiries or contract work: `EliSloan@proton.me`  
Prefers asynchronous, documented workflows. Minimal meetings by default.

No story is harder to trace than a system failure buried in silence. That’s where I start.
